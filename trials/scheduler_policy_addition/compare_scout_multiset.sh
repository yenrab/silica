# The order in which ready actors sharing one core are dispatched is defined only on a target whose
# runtime owns a per-core ready queue (ESP32-S3_raw). On a hosted target the actors are threads the OS
# schedules, so the same program prints the same lines in an order nobody defines. Hence two readings
# of one golden:
#   - a per-target golden (<stem>.<target>.scout, the board's reviewed expectation) is compared in
#     order, line for line, as diff -Bw does;
#   - the shared golden (<stem>.scout) is compared as a multiset of lines: the same lines, any order.
# The last line of both is the exit status, compared like any other line.
