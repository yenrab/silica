# Port test board: BYU Idaho ESP32-S3 board, version 4.0 (FEB26)

The `ESP32-S3_raw` port (Xtensa LX7, bare metal, no ESP-IDF runtime) was brought up and tested
on this board. Bring-up apps under `board/` use these pin assignments. Anything board-specific
in the runtime (console, LEDs, buttons) must come from this file, not from a generic ESP32-S3
DevKit pinout.

## What the hardware design says (authoritative over the sheet)

The board is the **BYU-I eBadge v4.0**. Design files: <https://github.com/BYU-I-eBadge/e-badge>,
folder `hardware v4.0/badge-esp32-s3/` (KiCad; `production/netlist.ipc` is the manufactured wiring).
Module: ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N4R2.

**GPIOs reach the peripherals only through jumpers on header J4** (2x15 socket). Odd J4 pins are
ESP32 GPIOs, the even pin beside each is a peripheral; a shunt across the pair connects them, so a
missing jumper disconnects that peripheral no matter what the software does:

| J4 pins | GPIO | Peripheral |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 | GPIO2 | RGB red (**the sheet says 1; the netlist says 2**) |
| 3-4 | GPIO4 | RGB green |
| 5-6 | GPIO5 | RGB blue |
| 7-8 | GPIO6 | single LED |
| 9-10 | GPIO7 | addressable LED chain (24 LEDs, powered from 5V_STABLE) |
| 11-12 | GPIO8 | joystick X |
| 13-14 | GPIO9 | joystick Y |
| 15-16 | GPIO10 | Right button |
| 17-18 | GPIO11 | Up button |
| 19-20 | GPIO21 | Left button |
| 21-22 | GPIO47 | Down button |
| 23-24 | GPIO33 | B button |
| 25-26 | GPIO34 | A button |
| 27-28 | GPIO48 | buzzer (MLT-5020 through a DTC114E transistor) |
| 29-30 | GPIO12 | battery voltage divider |

Directly wired (no jumper): display FPC `P2` on GPIO0, 1, 3, 45, 46; SD card on GPIO37-40; I2C
(accelerometer MMA8452Q at 0x1C, headers) on GPIO41/42; UART0 to the CP2102N on GPIO43/44;
minidip A header J9 on GPIO13-18; UART1 header on GPIO35/36.

## Measured on the port's test unit (2026-09-12)

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Chip | ESP32-S3 (QFN56) revision v0.2, dual core, 240 MHz rated, 40 MHz crystal |
| Memory | 4 MB embedded quad-SPI flash (XMC, 3.3 V by eFuse), 2 MB embedded quad PSRAM (AP_3v3) |
| MAC | 3c:0f:02:e3:af:68 |
| USB | UART bridge enumerates as `/dev/cu.usbserial-10` on macOS; the board has a power switch, and nothing enumerates while it is off |
| CPU clock after ROM hand-off | ~20 MHz (10.03 M CCOUNT cycles in 0.503 s of wall time); the ROM does not start the PLL |
| Flash backup before first flash | `/Volumes/2T/silica/board_backups/byui_esp32s3_v4.0_3c0f02e3af68_2026-09-12_full_flash.bin` (SHA-256 `82b068ae...98fc`); restore with `esptool write-flash 0x0 <file>` |
| Buttons Left/Right/Down/Up/A/B | **Active high**: read 0 at rest and 1 while pressed (external pull-downs win over the internal pull-up). Clean edges, no bounce seen at a 10 ms poll |
| Point (GPIO0) | Reads 1 at rest (external strapping pull-up) |
| RGB LED | **Red GPIO2, green GPIO4, blue GPIO5**, all active high (confirmed one colour at a time). The sheet's "Red: 1" is wrong: GPIO1 is a display-connector pin |
| Single LED (GPIO6) | Works, active high, but **faint**: a red 0603 LED behind 5.1 kΩ (~0.3 mA). Easy to miss in room light |
| Buzzer (GPIO48) | Works. Fed from +3.3 V through the **RV1 trimmer** (blue block marked W102 beside BUZZER1, a 0-1 kΩ volume control, 25-turn, slips at the ends); on this unit it arrived turned to the quiet end and was silent until turned ~30 turns counter-clockwise. Loudest at its 2.7 kHz resonance |
| Addressable LEDs (GPIO7) | Work: 24 x WS2813B-2121, GRB order, driven by a bit-banged stream (`asm_11_addressable_leds`) at the ROM's 20 MHz CPU clock without a level shifter (3.3 V data into 5 V LEDs). A square wave cannot light them (every long low is a reset) |
| J4 jumpers | All 15 fitted on this unit (photo, 2026-09-12) |

## Port notes (derived from the sheet, not part of it)

- **Console.** UART0 on GPIO43/44 is the ESP32-S3 ROM's default console, which ROM
  `ets_write_char_uart` already drives at 115200 8N1 after reset. The bare-metal runtime prints
  through it, so program output and the exit marker need no UART setup of their own.
- **Shared pins on the sheet.** Treat these as one physical line each until checked on the
  hardware: GPIO0 (Point button and display chip select), GPIO10 (Right button and display SPI
  CS), GPIO45 (display Data/Command and Minidip B CLK), GPIO12 (battery voltage and Minidip B
  IO3), GPIO37–40 (the SD card and the SPI3 bus are the same wires). Bring-up apps avoid the
  display and the minidips for that reason.
- **Strapping pins.** GPIO0, GPIO3, GPIO45 and GPIO46 are ESP32-S3 strapping pins, sampled at
  reset. Holding Point (GPIO0) low during reset enters the ROM download mode instead of running
  the image — useful for flashing, surprising for a test that reads that button at boot.
- **Module flash type.** Buttons A/B (GPIO33/34) and UART1/SPI3 (GPIO35–37) use pins that
  octal-SPI modules reserve for flash/PSRAM, so this board presumably carries a quad-SPI module.
  Not verified; it matters only when PSRAM support is added.
- **LEDs.** Which level lights LED (GPIO6) and the RGB LED (GPIO1/4/5), active-high or
  active-low, is not on the sheet. The blink app toggles, so either polarity is visible.
