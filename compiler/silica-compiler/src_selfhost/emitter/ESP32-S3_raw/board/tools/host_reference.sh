# Produce an app's expected.sout on the macOS host: compile the app with the host compiler, link
# and run it, and write "<stdout><exit status>\n" -- the same text the trial harness writes and the
# form run_on_board.py prints for the board. Run it once per app, before the app is tried on the board.
#
#   host_reference.sh <apps/silica_NN_name> [host-compiler]
#
# Default host compiler: /Volumes/2T/silica/binaries/silica-compiler. Scratch files go to a temporary
# directory. The link uses src_selfhost/main_entry_alias.s (the `_main` alias) and, when the program
# needs them, silica_rt_shim.s and deviceio_link_thunks.s from the same directory.
#
# An app that uses other modules (the stdlib) lists them in <app>/extra_sources.txt, one path per
# line relative to silica-compiler/, in dependency order; they are compiled before the app's own
# files. The board flow (README) uses the same list.
