# Compare a board run with an app's expected.sout the way the trial harness compares a .sout with its
# .scout: byte for byte except the process-fatal report lines of spec §15.4.5.5, whose addresses (and,
# on the host, the symbol and actor fields) differ between runs and targets. Both files go through
# trials/normalize_fatal_reports.awk, which folds such a line to "[silica] fault at <PTR>" or
# "[silica] abort: <reason> at <PTR>", and are then compared with diff. Exit status: diff's.
#
#   compare_sout.sh <board.sout> <apps/silica_NN_name/expected.sout>
#
# (run_on_board.py prints the .sout form: redirect its standard output to a file first.)
