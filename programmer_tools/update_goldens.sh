# THE DEFAULT IS A DRY RUN. Nothing is written without --apply. A dry run prints every golden
# that would change with a per-file "+added -removed" line count, and a per-platform summary.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT IS DELIBERATELY AWKWARD
#   Goldens in this project are hand-derived and are not auto-regenerated: a golden that changes
#   is a BEHAVIOUR CHANGE in the compiler, and blessing it in bulk can bless a real defect just as
#   easily as a real improvement. This script exists so that a bulk refresh is possible after a
#   reviewed, intended change, not so that it becomes routine. Review the diffs it prints, then
#   review `git diff` after --apply, the same way you would review compiler source.
#
# WHAT IT COMPARES, AND HOW A GOLDEN IS MADE
#   A trial's golden is a PLAIN COPY of the .sams the compiler emitted: the trial makefiles do
#   `diff -Bw <stem>.sams <stem><ASCOMP_EXT>` (trials/silica_compiler.mk defines ASCOMP_EXT), and
#   the two `record` targets that exist do `cp <stem>.sams <stem><ASCOMP_EXT>`. There is no
#   filtering and no banner folding on the assembly side. This script does exactly that copy, and
#   uses `diff -Bw` to decide whether a copy is needed, so its answer matches the harness's.
#
# GOLDEN NAMES PER PLATFORM (trials/silica_compiler.mk, ASCOMP_EXT)
#   apple_silicon_mac   <stem>.ascomp                  (the bare name is the original Darwin golden)
#   linux_aarch64       <stem>.linux_aarch64.ascomp
#   linux_x86_64        <stem>.linux_x86_64.ascomp
#   ESP32-S3_raw        <stem>.ESP32-S3_raw.ascomp     (none exist yet: the board target does not
#                                                       compare assembly, see trials/targets/README.md)
#
# WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES (all of this is hand-derived, or is not a golden at all)
#   *.scout and its variants (*.scout.multiset, *.scout.sorted, *.scout.normalized) - expected
#     program output and exit status, derived by hand.
#   *.<target>.scout - a reviewed, hand-recorded board-vs-host difference.
#   *.golden_fail, *.<target>.golden_fail, *.no_golden_fail - expected compiler diagnostics,
#     derived by hand (exit codes shift when literals are added; they are not mechanical).
#   *.sout, *.cur_fail - a run's actual output, never a golden.
#   __silica_runtime.ascomp - the runtime's assembly. Every trial makefile skips __silica_runtime
#     in its .ascomp loop, so these goldens are never compared by the harness and are already
#     stale in the tree. --include-runtime refreshes them anyway; the default leaves them alone.
#   A golden that has no current .sams beside it. Those are reported, never guessed at.
#   A missing golden. Recording a trial's first golden is hand work; --create-missing opts in, and
#     the dry run tells you how many there would be. One exception, the pairing rule the ad-hoc
#     refresher trials/tmp_refresh_ascomp_from_sams.sh already used and this script keeps: a trial
#     that has the bare <stem>.ascomp is a trial that compares assembly, so a HOSTED target may
#     create its own <stem>.<target>.ascomp beside it without the flag. A RAW target never does:
#     the board compares no assembly at all, so thousands of Xtensa goldens would be noise.
#   Anything outside trials/. The ten .ascomp files under compiler/ (the stdlib's Supervisor,
#     wbt_map, wbt_set and runtime goldens) are the compiler's own and are left alone.
#   A .sams whose architecture does not match the target it was asked to bless. That is the
#     "stale target .sams" trap: a cross build leaves the previous target's .sams in place. Such
#     a file is reported loudly and skipped, never copied.
#
# WHERE THE .sams COME FROM
#   This script never compiles and never builds a compiler. "Current .sams" means the files the
#   last trial run left in the tree:
#     native platform   trials/<suite>/**/<stem>.sams  (a suite's `integrate` cleans first and
#                       leaves its .sams behind; a tree-wide `make clean` removes them)
#     other hosted      the same files on that machine, pulled here with rsync over key-based ssh
#                       into a staging directory, then compared against the local golden
#     raw target        trials/.target/<target>/<suite>/src/**/<stem>.sams, the board run's work
#                       area, produced here by binaries/silica-compiler-<target>
#   If a suite has no .sams, run its trials first (`make -C trials/<suite> integrate`).
#
# WHICH PLATFORMS, AND WHERE THEIR MACHINES ARE
#   .silica_build_hosts in the repository root - the file programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh
#   writes - names the platforms and their machines, one line per platform:
#   "<emit target> <user@host|local> <repository path>", # starts a comment. It is read here and
#   never written. It is gitignored and must never be committed: it names your machines.
#     no flags            every platform in that file; without the file, this machine and any raw
#                         target whose work area exists
#     --targets "<list>"  only those platforms (comma or space separated)
#     --platform <t>      the same thing, one at a time
#     --remote <t>=<user@host>[:<path>]   a machine for one platform, for this run only
#     --local-only        this machine and the raw targets, no remote machines
#   Short names are accepted anywhere a platform is: mac, pi, nix, esp32, all, hosted.
#   Every remote connection is public/private key ssh: ssh runs in batch mode and never types a
#   password. Set it up with ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id, and check it with
#   `ssh -o BatchMode=yes user@host true`.
#
# SCOPE
#   --suite <dir>   limit to one suite, repeatable. A bare path argument does the same, so
#                   `update_goldens.sh trials/case_addition` and `--suite case_addition` agree.
#                   Without a scope the whole trials tree is swept, which takes a minute or two
#                   just to walk (12,000 .sams, 37,000 goldens).
#
# FLAGS
#   --apply            write the goldens. Without it nothing is written.
#   --suite <dir>      limit the scope (repeatable); bare paths do the same
#   --targets "<l>"    limit the platforms
#   --platform <t>     limit to one platform (repeatable)
#   --remote <t>=<c>[:<p>]   one connection, for this run
#   --local-only       no remote machines
#   --include-runtime  also refresh __silica_runtime.ascomp (the harness never compares it)
#   --create-missing   also write a golden that does not exist yet
#   --keep-fetched     leave the rsync staging directory behind, for inspection
#   --list             print what this run would look at, then stop
#   -h, --help         this header
#
# SUPERSEDES
#   trials/tmp_refresh_ascomp_from_sams.sh, a single-platform tool with no dry run that copies
#   every *.sams over its sibling golden, including __silica_runtime, and follows symlinked
#   directories while it walks. Everything it does, this script does with a dry run first.
