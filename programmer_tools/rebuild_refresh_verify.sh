#      you rather than whatever it happened to hold; --skip-sync trusts what is already there
#   0b. if a remote machine has no compiler of its own, send the newest matching native one from
#      this checkout's binaries/, and after a successful build copy the new one back here
#   1. build the compiler from compiler/src, after a clean, unless --skip-build
#   2. run the whole trial tree once, which is what produces the .sams the goldens come from
#   3. record the goldens, with programmer_tools/update_goldens.sh --apply, which refreshes only
#      trials whose run output already matched and never touches .scout or .golden_fail
#   4. run the whole tree again
# Step 4 is the answer you want: after step 3 every assembly-golden difference is gone, so what is
# left failing is a real behaviour difference, not a recorded expectation that went stale.
#
# With no --targets it asks which platforms to do, one question, and then asks for the connection of
# each hosted machine it does not already know. Connections are remembered in .silica_build_hosts in
# the repository root, the same file the build script writes, so it only asks once; --targets and
# --remote <target>=<user@host>[:<path>] skip the questions. --no-ask refuses to prompt at all.
# Every remote connection is public/private key ssh: the script runs ssh in batch mode and never types
# a password. Set a key up with ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id, and check it with
# `ssh -o BatchMode=yes user@host true`.
# A raw target (ESP32-S3_raw) is built here as a cross compiler and its trials run on the board
# attached to this machine. It has no golden step: the board harness compares program output only,
# never assembly, so there is nothing to record. Its run needs the board plugged in, and it takes the
# same tree-wide lock as this machine's own run, so the two never overlap.
#
# Each platform prints a before line and an after line. The exit status is 0 only when every
# platform's second run passed.
