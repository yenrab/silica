# Build and test the compiler

How to build Silica for every platform, for some of them, or for just the machine in front of you; how to run the trials on each platform; how to use the compiler that is already in the checkout without building anything; and where released compilers appear on GitHub.

These steps build the self-hosted toolchain ([roadmap](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) Track 1). This page mirrors the [README](https://github.com/yenrab/silica#building-the-compiler); the repository copy is the one kept in step with the Makefiles.

## You probably do not need to build the compiler

Building is for people who **change the compiler's own code** in `compiler/src/`, or who are porting
it to a new platform. If you are writing Silica programs, you do not need any of this: use the
compiler that is already in the checkout, or download a released one. Both are one section away, in
[Use the compiler that is already here](#use-the-compiler-that-is-already-here) and
[Get a released compiler from GitHub](#get-a-released-compiler-from-github).

Everything between here and those two sections is for compiler work.

## The compiler builds itself

Silica's compiler is written in Silica. There is no bootstrap compiler to build and no separate seed source tree: a compiler binary already in `binaries/` compiles the sources in [compiler/src/](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/tree/main/compiler/src/), and the compiler that comes out compiles them again until the two agree byte for byte. That last step is the **fixed point**, and it is what a finished build means. The binary that starts the chain is reached through `binaries/seed-compiler`, and a finished build becomes the next one.

Nothing in the build path is written in Rust, and nothing needs `cargo`. The retired Rust bootstrap lives only in the repository's history.

## Platforms

A platform is an **emit target**: the directory under [compiler/src/emitter/](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/tree/main/compiler/src/emitter/) whose backend a compiler bakes in. The table of record is [project_makefiles/platform/platforms.mk](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/project_makefiles/platform/platforms.mk).

| Emit target | Runs on | How it is built |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `apple_silicon_mac` | macOS on Apple Silicon (`macos-applesilicon`) | OS-hosted: built natively on an Apple Silicon Mac |
| `linux_aarch64` | Linux on AArch64 (`linux-aarch64`) | OS-hosted: built natively on a Linux AArch64 machine |
| `linux_x86_64` | Linux on x86-64 (`linux-x86_64`) | OS-hosted: built natively on a Linux x86-64 machine |
| `ESP32-S3_raw` | nothing — the ESP32-S3 has no OS | Raw: its cross compiler is built on whichever machine you start from |

An **OS-hosted** platform can run a compiler, so it builds its own and reaches its own fixed point on its own machine. A **raw** platform cannot run a compiler at all, so the compiler that emits its code is built elsewhere and published as `binaries/silica-compiler-<emit target>`.

## The three build scripts

| Script | What it does |
| ------ | ------------ |
| [`programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh`](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh) | Builds Silica for every platform you name, from whatever machine you start on. |
| [`programmer_tools/run_trials_all_platforms.sh`](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/programmer_tools/run_trials_all_platforms.sh) | Runs the full trial tree on each platform with that platform's own compiler. It never builds a compiler. |
| [`programmer_tools/build_and_trial_all_platforms.sh`](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/programmer_tools/build_and_trial_all_platforms.sh) | Both, in one command: build every indicated platform, then run the full trial tree on each one. |

Each script prints its own manual with `-h` or `--help`, and lists what a run would do — without doing it — with `--list`.

### Which machines, remembered once

`build_all_platforms.sh` writes the platforms and their machines to `.silica_build_hosts` in the repository root, one line per platform: `<emit target> <user@host|local> <repository path>`. The first run asks; later runs read it silently. `run_trials_all_platforms.sh` and `build_and_trial_all_platforms.sh` read the same file and never write it.

**`.silica_build_hosts` is gitignored and must never be committed**: it names your machines.

| Flag | Effect on the platform list |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| *(none)* | The file, if it exists; otherwise every supported platform, asking for each machine |
| `--targets "<list>"` | Only those platforms, this run only; the file is read but not rewritten |
| `--set_targets "<list>"` | Ask for that list and write (or replace) the file |
| `--refresh_targets` | Ask again for the platforms already in the file, and rewrite it |
| `--remote <target>=<user@host>[:<path>]` | One machine on the command line; the path defaults to `~/silica` |
| `--local-only` | This machine and the raw targets; no remote machines |

`--set_targets` and `--refresh_targets` ask and write even with `--list`, so you can record your machines without building anything.

### ssh must be key-based

Every remote connection is public/private key ssh. The scripts run `ssh` in batch mode and never type a password. Set a key up first and check it:

```bash
ssh-keygen                       # if you have no key yet
ssh-copy-id user@host
ssh -o BatchMode=yes user@host true
```

If that last command succeeds without prompting, the scripts can use the machine.

## Build for every platform

```bash
bash programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh --list   # the plan, then stop
bash programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh          # do it
```

The first run asks for each OS-hosted machine other than this one, checks the ssh key, and remembers the answers in `.silica_build_hosts`. Every later run needs no arguments.

## Build for some platforms

```bash
bash programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh --targets "apple_silicon_mac linux_x86_64"
```

`--targets` applies to that run only. To make a shorter list the standing default, record it instead:

```bash
bash programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh --set_targets "apple_silicon_mac linux_x86_64"
```

The machine you start from always builds its own native compiler first, whatever the list says; the list chooses which *other* platforms are built, and which raw cross compilers are built here.

## Build for just this machine

```bash
bash programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh --local-only
```

`--local-only` builds this machine's native target and every raw target's cross compiler here, and contacts no other machine. To build the native compiler and nothing else, name it and nothing else:

```bash
bash programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh --targets linux_x86_64   # on a Linux x86-64 machine
```

The script prints the machine it is on and the target it will build natively (`host platform` and `native target`) before it starts, so you can check you named the right one.

## Build a hosted platform on its own machine

An OS-hosted platform is never cross-built. Name its machine and the script does the work over ssh:

```bash
bash programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh \
    --remote linux_aarch64=admin@pix.local \
    --remote linux_x86_64=lee@nix.local:~/silica
```

For each such machine the script syncs the sources (never binaries or build products), then builds, takes the compiler to its fixed point and publishes it **there**.

One exception exists to the never-cross-build rule: a hosted machine that has no compiler of its own yet needs a first one handed to it. When the script finds no `binaries/silica-compiler` on the far side, it builds that target's compiler here, emits the assembly here, copies it over, and links the binary there. After that the machine builds its own compilers.

## Build a cross compiler for a raw device

A raw target has no OS and cannot host a compiler, so its cross compiler is always built on the machine you are sitting at:

```bash
bash programmer_tools/build_all_platforms.sh --targets ESP32-S3_raw
```

This machine still builds its own native compiler first; the raw cross compiler is built after it. The result is published as `binaries/silica-compiler-ESP32-S3_raw` on this machine, and its numbered binary is `binaries/silica-<NNNNNN>-ESP32_S3_raw-<platform>` (the emit target's hyphens become underscores in the file name). Board images are built and flashed separately; see [Required software]({{ '/required-software/' | relative_url }}).

## What a build does on each machine

Per machine the work is: build, gen1, gen2, the fixed-point check, and publish. `--no-fixpoint` stops after the build and skips the last four. One compiler build runs at a time per machine; the heaviest unit needs 6–8 GB of RAM.

| Flag | What it changes |
| ---- | --------------- |
| `--no-fixpoint` | Build only: no gen1, gen2, fixed-point check or publish |
| `--trials` | Run the trial tree after the build, on each machine that was built |
| `--jobs N` | Parallel jobs for the compiles |
| `--list` | Print the plan and stop |
| `--log-dir DIR` | Where the per-machine logs go (default: `../silica_builds/<timestamp>` beside the repository) |

The run ends with a `done:` / `failed:` line, names any platform it skipped for want of a machine, and says where the binaries and logs are.

## Run the trials on every platform

```bash
bash programmer_tools/run_trials_all_platforms.sh --list     # what it would run
bash programmer_tools/run_trials_all_platforms.sh            # every platform it knows
bash programmer_tools/run_trials_all_platforms.sh --targets linux_x86_64
bash programmer_tools/run_trials_all_platforms.sh --remote linux_aarch64=admin@pix.local
bash programmer_tools/run_trials_all_platforms.sh --sync --board
```

This script never builds a compiler. Each machine must already have its own native compiler at `<repo>/binaries/silica-compiler`; a raw target is driven from this machine with the cross compiler this machine built for it.

- `--targets "<list>"` takes emit-target names, or the short names `mac`, `pi`, `nix`, `esp32`, `all` and `hosted`, which are accepted anywhere a platform is.
- `--board` also runs a raw target's trials on an attached board; board runs are off by default.
- `--sync` copies trials, stdlib and project makefiles to each remote machine first — never binaries or build products.
- `--log-dir DIR` sets where logs and reports land (default: `../silica_trial_runs/<timestamp>`).
- `--mac-jobs`, `--pi-jobs` and `--nix-jobs` set the parallelism for those machines.

Remote machines run at the same time as each other. This machine runs its own trials and then the board, because both take `trials/.integrate.lock` — one trial run per machine. The script prints one summary table at the end and exits 0 only when every platform passed.

## Build and then run the trials, in one command

```bash
bash programmer_tools/build_and_trial_all_platforms.sh --list
bash programmer_tools/build_and_trial_all_platforms.sh
bash programmer_tools/build_and_trial_all_platforms.sh --targets "apple_silicon_mac linux_x86_64"
bash programmer_tools/build_and_trial_all_platforms.sh --local-only --board
```

It runs `build_all_platforms.sh` and then `run_trials_all_platforms.sh`, and both steps read the same `.silica_build_hosts`, so the platforms you name or record once are used twice. It takes the same platform flags as the build script (`--targets`, `--set_targets`, `--refresh_targets`, `--remote`, `--local-only`) plus `--board`, `--sync`, `--jobs`, `--no-fixpoint`, `--skip-build`, `--skip-trials`, `--list` and `--log-dir DIR` (build logs in `DIR/build`, trial logs and reports in `DIR/trials`; the default is `../silica_releases/<timestamp>`).

The trials do not run if the builds fail: a trial result only means something when it came from a compiler that built cleanly. Run the trials script on its own if you want them anyway. The exit status is 0 only when every build and every trial run passed.

## Use the compiler that is already here

Nothing above is needed to compile Silica programs. A checkout already carries built compilers in [`binaries/`](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/tree/main/binaries/), and applications and the trial tree reach them through stable links:

| Link | What it points at |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| `binaries/silica-compiler` | The newest compiler that runs on **this** machine and emits code for it. This is the one applications use. |
| `binaries/silica-compiler-<emit target>` | The newest compiler that runs here and emits code for another target, for example `binaries/silica-compiler-ESP32-S3_raw`. |
| `binaries/seed-compiler` | The compiler used to **build the compiler**. It advances only when a build reaches its fixed point. Nothing else uses it. |

A compiler binary is named `silica-<NNNNNN>-<platform>`, for example `silica-999970-macos-applesilicon`. `<platform>` is where the binary **runs**; a cross compiler carries the emit target as an extra token, `silica-<NNNNNN>-<emit_target>-<platform>`, and a compiler published for building the compiler carries `seed`, `silica-<NNNNNN>-seed-<platform>`. `<NNNNNN>` is a generation counter that counts **down**: the lowest number is the newest build. Each kind is numbered independently and their links never cross.

The compiler takes no `--version` flag, and the strings inside the binary do not identify it. A build is identified by its **file name**, so ask the link what it resolves to:

```bash
ls -l binaries/silica-compiler
readlink binaries/silica-compiler
```

Two scripts maintain those links:

- **[`binaries/install_compiler.bash`](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/binaries/install_compiler.bash)** installs a freshly built binary into `binaries/` and repoints its stable link at it. It takes the kind, then the path to the binary: `install_compiler.bash selfhost <binary>` publishes a compiler for this host and moves `binaries/silica-compiler` to it; `install_compiler.bash target <emit-target> <binary>` publishes a cross compiler and moves `binaries/silica-compiler-<emit-target>`; `install_compiler.bash seed <binary>` publishes the compiler that builds the compiler and moves `binaries/seed-compiler`. It works out the next number itself (one below the lowest existing number for that kind). The build scripts call it for you.
- **[`binaries/update_silica_compiler_link.bash`](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/binaries/update_silica_compiler_link.bash)** is the repair path for a missing or stale `silica-compiler` link. It scans `binaries/` for versioned binaries, detects your host platform, picks the newest one built for it, makes it executable and points `binaries/silica-compiler` at it. Run it with no arguments; if it cannot tell which platform you want, it lists the platforms it found and asks. It only ever selects a compiler that runs on this host and emits for it: never a cross compiler, and never a `-seed-` build, because compiling applications with the wrong one is exactly the mistake the separate links exist to prevent.

## Get a released compiler from GitHub

The repository is [github.com/yenrab/silica](https://github.com/yenrab/silica) and its releases are at [github.com/yenrab/silica/releases](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/releases). That page is where published compilers appear. If it is empty, no release has been published yet; build from source with the scripts above, or use the binaries already in the checkout.

A release asset is a compiler binary under the same naming rule as the ones in `binaries/`, so pick the one whose `<platform>` matches the machine you will run it on — `macos-applesilicon`, `linux-aarch64` or `linux-x86_64` — and, for a cross compiler, whose emit-target token matches the device you are building for. `binaries/update_silica_compiler_link.bash` will tell you what this machine's platform id is.

Download it into `binaries/`, make it executable, and point the link at it:

```bash
curl -L -o binaries/<asset-name> <the asset's download URL>
chmod +x binaries/<asset-name>
bash binaries/update_silica_compiler_link.bash
```

`update_silica_compiler_link.bash` picks the newest binary for your host platform, which is the downloaded one when its number is the lowest present. To point the link at a specific file instead:

```bash
ln -sfn <asset-name> binaries/silica-compiler
```

Use a relative name, not a path: the link lives in `binaries/` and must resolve inside it.

## The make targets behind the scripts

The scripts drive the Makefile in [compiler/src/](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/tree/main/compiler/src/). You need these directly only when working on the compiler itself.

| Command (run in `compiler/src/`) | What it does |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `make` / `make build` | Full build with `binaries/seed-compiler`: config → compile → objects → link → install. |
| `make gen1` | Build the compiler with `binaries/seed-compiler`, and keep the result as `binaries/silica-gen1`. |
| `make gen2` | Build it again with `binaries/silica-gen1`, and keep the result as `binaries/silica-gen2`. Every unit is recompiled: the compiler binary is a staleness input, so there is no incremental path between generations. |
| `make fixpoint` | Build gen3 with gen2 and pass only if gen3 is byte-identical to gen2 (see below). |
| `make trials-gen1` / `make trials-gen2` / `make trials-both` | Run the whole trial tree against a generation, keeping each report as `trials/.integrate_report.gen1` or `.gen2`. |
| `make assembly` / `make objects` / `make executables` | Compile only / assemble `.sams` → `.o` / link. |
| `make clean` | Remove generated artifacts (`.sams`, `.o`, configs, iface caches, the local executable). |
| `make all` | `clean`, then `build`. |
| `make help` | List targets, the active emit target, and allowable `TARGET` values. |
| `make TARGET=<name>` | Bake a specific backend from `emitter/<name>/` (writes `silica.target`). A backend other than the host's is published as `binaries/silica-compiler-<name>`, never as `binaries/silica-compiler`. |
| `make all-targets` | Clean and build once per allowable emit target. |
| `make EXECUTABLE=<name>` | Override the output binary name (default: `silica-compiler`). |
| `make build SILICA_COMPILER=<binary>` | Compile with any compiler binary (this is what `gen2` does with `silica-gen1`). |
| `INSTALL_SELFHOST=0` | On either generation: build and keep the `silica-genN` copy without touching the numbered install or the `silica-compiler` link. |

**Emit target.** With more than one backend under `emitter/`, an interactive `make` first asks which one to bake in:

```
Select the emit target (emitter/<name>/ to bake into silica-compiler):
  1) ESP32-S3_raw
  2) apple_silicon_mac  [default: host]
  3) linux_aarch64
Number or name [apple_silicon_mac]:
```

Answer with a number or a name; an empty answer takes the host default. The choice is written to `silica.target` and passed to the sub-makes, so you are asked once per build. `make TARGET=<name>` skips the question, `SILICA_TARGET_PROMPT=0` always takes the host default (this is what the scripts pass), and builds without a terminal (CI, `nohup`, pipes) take the host default silently. `make help` and `make clean` never ask. `TARGET` is a code-generation backend baked into the binary, not a runtime switch and not the `binaries/` host platform tag.

**The fixed point.** `make fixpoint` builds gen3 — `compiler/src` compiled by `binaries/silica-gen2` — and passes only if gen3 is byte-identical to gen2. Passing the trials shows gen2 compiles programs correctly; the fixed point shows the compiler reproduces itself with nothing inherited from the compiler that started the chain.

It must run right after `make gen2`: the `.sams` left in `compiler/src/` are then gen1's emission of the sources, and `make gen2` stamps them. The target refuses to run if that stamp is missing or any `.sams` was rewritten since, saves those `.sams` to `compiler/.src_fixpoint/gen1_sams/`, builds gen3 with gen2, and prints how many units gen2 emits differently from gen1 (with the first differing lines, `o<N>` node counters normalised) and both binary sizes. gen3 is linked at the same path as gen2, `compiler/src/silica-compiler`, because Apple's linker derives the binary's UUID and signature identifier from the output path; it is not installed and is kept as `silica-compiler-gen3`. Running it again needs a fresh `make gen2`.

## Prerequisites

The complete list, with versions, install commands and the ESP32-S3 board tools, is on its own page: [Required software]({{ '/required-software/' | relative_url }}).

| Requirement | Role |
| ----------- | ---- |
| A Silica compiler for this host | `binaries/silica-compiler`. Present in the checkout; `binaries/update_silica_compiler_link.bash` repairs the link for your host platform. Every build starts from one. |
| GNU Make | Drives every build and the trial tree. |
| Clang | Assembles `.sams` → `.o` and links. On Apple Silicon with Homebrew LLVM, the Makefiles prefer `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang` when present. |
| `rsync` and key-based `ssh` | Only for building or running trials on another machine. |

## Runtime (Track 2): no single documented build yet

[Track 2](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) is foreign interoperability and, later, brokered IPC. Exact build and link steps for that path are still to be defined. Until then, the self-hosted compiler build above is the supported path.

## The trial tree

CI trials live under [trials/](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/tree/main/trials/). Each suite directory (for example `atoms_addition`, `case_addition`, `error_enforcement_addition`, `ordered_data_structures`) holds Silica sources and golden files: `.ascomp` (expected assembly), `.scout` (expected stdout followed by the exit code), and `.golden_fail` (expected compiler diagnostics for programs that must not compile). The [trials Makefile](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/trials/Makefile) compiles every trial with the chosen compiler, compares the assembly to `.ascomp`, assembles and links, runs the binary, and compares its output to `.scout` (or the diagnostics to `.golden_fail`). Suites run in parallel; a counter line at the bottom of the terminal shows passes and failures as they happen.

## Run the tree or one suite with any compiler

```bash
cd trials
make integrate                                    # default: binaries/silica-compiler (the newest build for this host)
make integrate SILICA_COMPILER=/path/to/compiler  # any binary
make -C case_addition integrate SILICA_COMPILER=/path/to/compiler   # one suite
```

`make integrate` is the Makefile default, so plain `make` in `trials/` does the same. A few suites are not part of the tree run and must be run directly: any suite with an `INTEGRATE_PENDING` marker is skipped (see its README).

## Run the trials on an ESP32-S3 board

The same trials can run on an ESP32-S3 board over USB: compiled by `binaries/silica-compiler-ESP32-S3_raw`, loaded into the board's RAM one at a time, and compared with the same `.scout` goldens. An interactive `make integrate` asks where to run (Enter = this machine); set `TRIAL_TARGET` to skip the question:

```bash
cd trials
make integrate TRIAL_TARGET=ESP32-S3_raw          # the whole tree on the board (takes hours)
make integrate TRIAL_TARGET=both                  # this machine, then the board
make -C case_addition integrate TRIAL_TARGET=ESP32-S3_raw   # one suite on the board
```

Only one trial run, host or board, can be in progress at a time; a second one stops and names the run in progress. The board run writes its report to `trials/.integrate_report.ESP32-S3_raw` and leaves the host's results untouched. How it works, what it skips and its settings: [trials/targets/README.md](https://github.com/yenrab/silica/blob/main/trials/targets/README.md). What it needs installed: [Required software]({{ '/required-software/' | relative_url }}).

## Reading a report

`trials/.integrate_report` starts with the totals and then lists each failing trial with its reason (`.sams differs from .ascomp`, `.sout differs from .scout`, `.cur_fail differs from .golden_fail`, `compilation failed`, `missing executable`, and so on).

- **Trust the totals.** If the `fail:` count is higher than the number of listed lines, a suite failed as a whole (for example its batch compile aborted on one trial) and has no per-trial lines; open that suite's `.integrate_log` for the reason.
- **`missing executable (assemble/link failed earlier)`** on hundreds of trials in one suite usually means a single `.sams` in that suite failed to assemble; the `assemble failed` line names it.
- **Assembly drift** (`.sams differs from .ascomp`) with matching runtime output is expected after an emitter change; the report prints the first differing lines. Goldens are never regenerated automatically: copy a trial's `.sams` over its `.ascomp` only after confirming the runtime result, and use `make record-golden SUB_TRIALS=<leaf>` in `ordered_data_structures/` for those leaves.
- `trials/count_trial_files.sh` prints how many golden files (`.ascomp`, `.scout`, `.golden_fail`) the tree holds.

Other useful targets in `trials/`:

- `make clean` — remove generated executables, `.sams`, `.o`, `.sout`, and per-suite counters (keeps the goldens).
- `make help` — list targets and suites.
- `make integrate-ffi` — the success-path FFI application trials only.

The harness needs the same toolchain as the compiler build on whichever machine it runs (see [Required software]({{ '/required-software/' | relative_url }})). Some suites have their own READMEs.
